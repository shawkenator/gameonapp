<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.5pt;text-indent:0in'>Timesonline.com
collects information about you to enhance your experience on our website. We
want to deliver news and information that's important to you. We will not sell
your information to another party. </p>

we use it?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.5pt;text-indent:0in'>When you sign up
as a registered user at Timesonline.com, we ask for some basic demographic
information. We want to deliver news and information that's important to you.
So we ask for your ZIP code or other information so we can customize your
experience. We may also ask you for other information at other times — such as
when you enter a contest or participate in a promotion, when you post an online
ad, when you participate in our message boards, or when you order products from
us. Whenever you provide personally identifiable information to us, we will
make an effort to link to this privacy policy. Web servers for Timesonline.com
automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such as
which pages each user visits and the domain name (e.g., msn.com) of visitors.
This information is used for various purposes including internal review, to
tailor information to individual visitors, and for traffic audits. We also
provide this information (as well as information from third-party market
researchers) about our users in an aggregated, anonymous basis to our
advertisers and potential advertisers. Timesonline.com <span class=GramE>places
a &quot;cookie&quot; on users’ computers</span> to store and sometimes track
information. A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a website;
we may also use this information for editorial purposes such as measuring
traffic patterns (i.e. cookies can ensure that you don't see the same ad too
many times in a session and that you do not have to re-enter your registration
information during your visit). We may also use cookies to track your progress
and number of entries in some of our promotions and contests. Advertising
service vendors that serve ads into our site may also use their own cookies.
You may opt out of the cookies delivered by Timesonline.com by changing the
setting on your browser. Be aware that this will disable all cookies delivered
to your browser, not just the one delivered by Timesonline.com. </p>
