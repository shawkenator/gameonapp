<p>In 1954, Calkins Newspapers Inc. purchased the Doylestown Intelligencer, which can trace its roots back to a weekly that began publishing in 1804, from Senator Joseph Grundy. Calkins ran The Daily Intelligencer as an afternoon newspaper until the 1970s. It also published a sister paper The Montgomery County Record (later The Record) in the 1980s and 1990s. Today The Intelligencer, which publishes six days a week, covers Central Bucks County, Upper Bucks County and Eastern Montgomery County. Its Bucks County towns include Doylestown, New Hope, Warminster, New Britain, Perkasie, Quakertown, Sellersville and Dublin and Central Bucks, Pennridge and Palisades school districts and others. In Montgomery County, the paper's towns include Willow Grove, Montgomeryville, Hatboro, Horsham and Upper Moreland. Its pages feature stories, photographs and editorials about everything from municipal and community news and crime and court reports to politics, business, human interest, sports and entertainment pieces. The newspaperâ€™s main office is located at 333 N. Broad St. in Doylestown. </p>
