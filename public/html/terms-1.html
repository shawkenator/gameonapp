<p>We at BucksCountyCourierTimes.com are very sensitive to issues of individual privacy on the Internet. To that end, we provide the following policy on the use of information gathered on BucksCountyCourierTimes.com:</p>

<p><b>Categories of information collected</b></p>
<p>BucksCountyCourierTimes.com gathers identifying information about individuals only when individuals provide that information on a voluntary basis such as on our reader reaction forums, for our SMS and email alerts, and in our secure ecommerce store.</p>

<p><b>Third parties</b></p>
<p>It is not the policy of Calkins Media to sell or make available such information to unrelated third parties; occasionally such information may be shared with other divisions of Calkins Media. We may inform advertisers of the results of such analyses. And under any circumstance, BucksCountyCourierTimes.com will refer only to general, aggregate usage data from these analyses - never specific identifying information. BucksCountyCourierTimes.com performs statistical analyses of its server logs to study the use and popularity of various areas of our site. We also look at IP addresses to analyze where we are getting our audience.</p>

<p>Users should keep in mind that, when posting their user name or e-mail address on bulletin boards or in other user-posted content areas, that information, along with any information in their postings, can be read by any third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. BucksCountyCourierTimes.com has no control over that.</p>

<p>BucksCountyCourierTimes.com may make use of or refer to user-posted content for the purposes of promotion of BucksCountyCourierTimes.com. This will mainly involve taking screen shots of a particular area of the site and using that screen shot as a graphic in an advertisement. BucksCountyCourierTimes.com makes no claim of ownership to such user-posted content.</p>

<p>BucksCountyCourierTimes.com employs 'cookies' in circumstances that require session data or require user verification.</p>

<p><b>Process to remove your personal information</b></p>
<p>Most of our services include information on how to remove your information and cancel the service. You may alternatively send us an email at feedback@calkins.com requesting the services and information you would like removed.</p>

<p><b>Changes to this policy &amp; effective dates</b></p>
