<p><b>A history</b></p>
<p>Flush from his mortal wounding of Alexander Hamilton and intent on conquering the Spanish Territories with a small flotilla of locally built Orleans boats, former Vice President Aaron Burr had just shoved off from the confluence of the Beaver and Ohio rivers when the first newspaper was printed in the frontier forestland of western Pennsylvania's Beaver County.</p>

<p>Burr's expedition foundered. But The Minerva, a four-page weekly that rolled off a single-sheet wood and iron press on Nov. 4, 1807, wrote the introduction to a long and colorful story of newspapering in Beaver County that has seen the publication of at least 122 nameplates.</p>

<p>The culmination of that history is The Beaver County Times, which traces its 160-year lineage to the Beaver Times. First published in the county seat of Beaver in 1851, this publication has changed names as frequently as it has changed owners.</p>

<p><b>A timeline of The Times:</b><br />
1851-1859: The Beaver Times.<br />
1859-1909: Beaver Argus.<br />
1909-1946: The Daily Times.<br />
1946:-1959: The Beaver Valley Times.<br />
1960-today: The Beaver County Times.</p>

<p><b>Modern Times</b></p>
<p>The Beaver County Times today is the county's primary information source and sole daily newspaper. Its emergence as the premiere news outlet for western Pennsylvania was engineered by an emerging media magnate, S.W. Calkins of Uniontown, who purchased his first Beaver County newspaper, the Aliquippa Gazette, in 1943. Three years later he purchased The Beaver Daily Times and combined the two papers to create The Beaver Valley Times.</p>
<p>In 1959 Calkins purchased the Ambridge Daily Citizen and shortly thereafter renamed his combined publications The Beaver County Times. He moved the company in 1964 to its current location in Bridgewater, overlooking Burr's disembarkation point. When Calkins Media purchased The News Tribune of Beaver Falls in 1978, The Times achieved its pre-eminence as the region's largest suburban daily newspaper.</p>

<p>The Times business success under the Calkins name reflected the prosperity of the steel and coal years and mirrors the transition of the area to a diversified economy based on aviation, education and information technology. The anchor of Calkins' western publishing division, The Times also publishes a daily edition for Pittsburgh's county, The Allegheny Times, and a free weekly, The Valley Tribune. The Times also operates The Ellwood City Ledger, a daily newspaper in southern Lawrence County.</p>

<p>Calkins Media, based in Levittown, Pa., owns daily newspapers in Levittown; Uniontown, Pa.; Doylestown, Pa.; Willingboro, N.J.; and Homestead, Fla. Calkins also owns television stations in Florida and Alabama, and interactive media sites.</p>
